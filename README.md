# Introduction

This GitHub provide an example how to generate reports related to your App Registration in Azure Active Directory.  When your applications stacks growth in Azure Active Directory it can be difficult to keep track (inventory) of what you have there with the permissions of those applications.

This GitHub propose one solution (proof of concept) that you can leverage using Serverless technologies.  The goal was to writte the less code possible, to do so, Logic App and Azure Function (small piece of code) where used here.

The list of reports generated by this PoC are the following:

<ul>
    <li>Applications registration with their owners</li>
    <li>Applications registration with less than two owners</li>
    <li>Applications registration with credentials that will expired in the next 3 months</li>
    <li>Applications registration with their permission</li>
</ul>

**Important**, the logic app use the built-in connector for **CosmosDB** that is currently in **preview**.  This connector was used for better DevOps and this PoC come **"AS IS"** without any **warranty**.  If you create the same concept of production workload and the connector is still in preview is recommended to use the Azure managed connector.
